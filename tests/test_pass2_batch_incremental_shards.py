"""Tests for incremental on_file_done flushing in run_pass2_batched.

A file's chunks can land in many non-adjacent batches (build_pass2_batches does
cross-file bin-packing by default), so on_file_done must fire as soon as every
chunk belonging to a file has appeared in a completed (post-retry) batch —
not only once, at the very end, after every batch in the whole corpus finishes.
This is what makes cancel/resume for `pass2.prep_mode: batch_chunks` possible:
a crash mid-run only loses batches still in flight, not everything computed
so far.
