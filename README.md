## Features

### Ontology-Guided Extraction

- **Schema-guided knowledge graph generation** — the extracted graph is always grounded in a formal RDFS/OWL schema: concept types, property names, domain/range constraints, and the is-a hierarchy are explicit and inspectable before any entity is extracted
- **Bring your own ontology** — supply a `--base-schema` TTL file to lock in classes and properties from an existing formal ontology; the LLM expands it with domain-specific concepts but cannot rename, remove, or contradict your authoritative vocabulary
- **SKOS thesaurus support** — pass `--thesaurus` to load a SKOS vocabulary; `skos:exactMatch` terms are collapsed silently, `skos:closeMatch` terms trigger a warning — giving the schema merger richer synonym awareness than string matching alone
- **Verifiable TTL ontology** — after Pass 1, the induced schema is exported as a valid RDFS/OWL Turtle file (`intermediate/schema.ttl`) that can be opened directly in ontology editors such as [Protégé](https://protege.stanford.edu/). The TTL is validated by rdflib (syntax + semantic checks: domain/range refer to declared classes, no conflicting ranges) before any extraction begins
- **Human-in-the-loop ontology design** — run with `--review` to pause after schema induction; inspect and edit `schema.json` (or load `schema.ttl` in Protégé, modify, and save back) before a single entity is extracted; resume with `mykg approve-schema`
- **Incremental updates** — run with `--append` on an existing session to add new or modified Markdown files without re-running Pass 1; the schema is reused and only the new files go through Pass 2
- **AI coding assistant friendly** — designed for smooth use alongside AI coding assistants such as [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code); run extractions, inspect outputs, and iterate on your knowledge graph without leaving your coding environment; see [Using mykg with Claude Code](#using-mykg-with-claude-code)
- **Second brain for AI coding assistants** — the Obsidian vault output turns your extracted knowledge graph into a directory of wikilinked Markdown notes that any AI coding assistant can read as project context; point Claude Code, Cursor, or Copilot at `output/obsidian_vault/` and ask questions, trace relationships, and get answers grounded in your own documents

### Input

- **Mixed-format corpora** — point `mykg extract-graph` at any directory; supported extensions are converted to Markdown automatically before ingest:

  | Format | Extensions | Backend |
  |---|---|---|
  | Markdown | `.md` | passthrough (consumed as-is) |
  | PDF, Word, PowerPoint, images | `.pdf .docx .doc .pptx .png .jpg .jpeg` | [MinerU](https://github.com/opendatalab/mineru) in an ephemeral `uv`-managed Python 3.12 venv — nothing is installed into your active environment |
  | HTML | `.html .htm` | [`markdownify`](https://pypi.org/project/markdownify/) in-process; anchors and image tags stripped |

  Anything outside the allowlist (e.g. `.svg`, `.css`, `.php` assets next to an HTML bundle) is logged and skipped, never silently dropped. The allowlist is configurable via `preprocess.extensions` in `mykg_config.yaml`.

  **Incremental conversion** — unchanged source files are skipped on re-run. Adding one PDF to a corpus and re-running only re-converts that PDF. Force a full re-conversion with `mykg extract-graph --from-step preprocess`.


### Graph & Output

- **Provider-agnostic** — works with Anthropic (Claude), OpenAI (GPT), Ollama (local), OpenRouter, or the `claude` CLI
- **Five output families** — JSONL for Neo4j/NetworkX/RAG, Turtle RDF for OWL toolchains, NetworkX multi-format for graph analysis, Obsidian vault for linked personal knowledge management, and an optional Neo4j LOAD CSV bundle (plain-header CSVs + paste-and-run Cypher script for Neo4j Browser / `cypher-shell`)
- **Obsidian vault — second brain for AI coding assistants** — every extracted entity becomes a wikilinked Markdown note in `output/obsidian_vault/`; open it in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) to navigate the graph with backlinks and Graph View, or point your AI coding assistant (Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot) at the vault folder so it can answer questions, trace relationships, and reason over your knowledge base in natural language
- **Interactive HTML graph** — node/edge filtering, search, hover popups; opens directly in a browser
- **Confidence scoring** — every extracted attribute, node, and edge carries a `0.0–1.0` confidence score
- **Name normalization** — surface-form variants ("Acme Corp", "ACME", "Acme Corporation") resolved to a single canonical node with aliases
- **Orphan-connection pass** — reconnects isolated nodes via co-occurrence heuristic + LLM confirmation
- **Cross-session merge** — combine two independently-produced graphs into one unified knowledge graph
- **Resumable pipeline** — every stage persists intermediate state; re-enter at any step after a crash or edit
- **Session isolation** — each run is fully self-contained; inputs, intermediate state, outputs, and logs co-located
- **Query knowledge graph** — natural-language queries directly against the extracted graph via AI coding assistants such as [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code).

## Command line

```
mykg extract-graph my_notes/        # any directory: .md, .pdf, .docx, .html, images
```
It uses a **two-pass LLM pipeline**: Pass 1 induces a global RDFS/OWL schema from your document corpus; Pass 2 extracts typed entity and relationship instances per file against that schema. Non-Markdown inputs (`.pdf .docx .doc .pptx .png .jpg .jpeg .html .htm`) are converted to Markdown automatically before extraction. The result is exported to multiple formats: JSONL for property-graph consumers such as Neo4j, Turtle RDF for OWL toolchains, seven NetworkX formats for graph analysis and visualization, an Obsidian vault — a second brain of wikilinked Markdown notes your AI coding assistant (Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot) can read and reason over directly — and optionally a Neo4j LOAD CSV bundle with a paste-and-run Cypher script for one-step import into Neo4j Browser or `cypher-shell`.


## Quick Start

Requires Python 3.11+ and one of: an Anthropic/OpenAI/OpenRouter API key, Ollama running locally, or the `claude` CLI.

### Install from PyPI

Install mykg, then run the interactive setup wizard — it asks for your provider, model, and API key and writes `mykg_config.yaml` and `.env.mykg` in one step.

```bash
pip install mykg
mykg init
mykg extract-graph my_notes/
```

Open `mykg_sessions/<timestamp>/output/knowledge_graph.html` in your browser to explore the result.

### Install from source

Install [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/), clone the repo, sync dependencies, run the setup wizard, then extract.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SenolIsci/mykg && cd mykg
uv sync && mykg init
uv run mykg extract-graph my_notes/
```

For Ollama (local inference, no API key needed), pull a model and select the `ollama-local` profile when `mykg init` prompts you.

```bash
ollama pull llama3.3
mykg init
mykg extract-graph my_notes/
```

## Configuration

All configuration lives in a single `mykg_config.yaml` file discovered automatically from the working directory (or any parent). There are no hardcoded defaults in the code — the YAML is the sole source of truth.

```bash
mykg init           # interactive: choose provider, model, paste API key
                    # writes mykg_config.yaml and .env.mykg in one step
mykg init --force   # overwrite an existing config
mykg init --profile openrouter-free --model google/llama-4-maverick --api-key sk-or-...  # non-interactive
```

The wizard walks you through three prompts:

1. **Profile** — choose your LLM provider (OpenRouter, Anthropic, OpenAI, Ollama, Claude CLI, or Agent / Claude Code skill)
2. **Model** — accept the default or type any model slug for that provider *(skipped in agent mode — the host Claude Code session is the LLM)*
3. **API key** — paste your key (skipped for Ollama, Claude CLI, and agent mode)

### LLM Providers

| Provider | Profile name | API key env var | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Anthropic (Claude) | `anthropic-claude` | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | Recommended for quality |
| OpenAI | `openai` | `OPENAI_API_KEY` | |
| Ollama | `ollama-local` | — | Local inference, no key needed |
| OpenRouter | `openrouter-free` | `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` | Access many models via one key |
| Claude CLI | `claude-cli` | — | Uses `claude -p` subprocess; serial only |
| Agent (Claude Code skill) | `agent-claude-code` | — | LLM answers come from a Claude Code skill via filesystem inbox/outbox — see [docs/agent-mode.md](docs/agent-mode.md) |

Switch provider by setting `profile:` at the top of [`mykg_config.yaml`](mykg_config.yaml).


### API Keys

myKG reads API keys from environment variables. Set them by exporting directly or by creating a `.env.mykg` file in your project directory (loaded automatically on startup).

**Option A — export in your shell:**

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
```

**Option B — create a `.env.mykg` file:**

```bash
# .env.mykg
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
```
For source installs you can also copy [`sample.env.mykg`](sample.env.mykg) to `.env.mykg` as a starting template.


## Extract Pipeline

Reads a directory of mixed format files and produces a typed knowledge graph in three output formats. The pipeline runs 12 sequential steps; all intermediate state is persisted so any step can be re-entered without repeating upstream work.

### Running

```bash
mykg extract-graph <input_dir> [OPTIONS]
# source installs: uv run mykg extract-graph <input_dir> [OPTIONS]
```

`<input_dir>` is any directory containing your source files. Subdirectories are included recursively. Only files matching the configured extensions are copied into the session:

- `.md` — always included (the pipeline's native format)
- All extensions listed under `preprocess.extensions` in `mykg_config.yaml` (`.pdf`, `.docx`, `.doc`, `.pptx`, `.png`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.html`, `.htm` by default)

Everything else (`.py`, `.json`, `.yaml`, lock files, etc.) is ignored. Hidden directories (`.venv`, `.git`, etc.) and the sessions folder are also excluded automatically, so you can safely point `extract-graph` at the project root or any parent directory.

### Options

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| `--session NAME` | Resume an existing session by folder name |
| `--from-step NAME` | Delete a step's outputs and re-run from that point |
| `--review` | Pause after Pass 1 for manual schema review |
| `--append` | Skip Pass 1; re-run only on new/modified files |
| `--workers N` | Parallel workers for Pass 2 |
| `--confidence-agg mean\|max` | Confidence aggregation when deduplicating |
| `--base-schema PATH` | Locked TBox TTL file (locked classes/properties cannot be changed by the LLM) |
| `--thesaurus PATH` | SKOS TTL thesaurus for synonym resolution in schema merge |
| `--obsidian-vault` | Force Obsidian vault export for this run (overrides config) |
| `--neo4j-csv` | Force Neo4j LOAD CSV bundle export for this run (overrides config) |
| `--log-file PATH` | Write logs here (relative paths placed inside the session folder) |
| `--verbose / -v` | Enable DEBUG-level logging |

### Examples

```bash
# New run — auto-creates a timestamped session
mykg extract-graph my_notes/

# Resume a session with 4 parallel Pass 2 workers
mykg extract-graph my_notes/ --session 2026-05-17T18-31-07 --workers 4

# Pause for schema review after Pass 1
mykg extract-graph my_notes/ --review
# → edit mykg_sessions/<name>/intermediate/schema.json
mykg approve-schema --session 2026-05-17T18-31-07
mykg extract-graph my_notes/ --session 2026-05-17T18-31-07 --review

# Re-run from assembly onward (reuses existing extractions)
mykg extract-graph my_notes/ --session 2026-05-17T18-31-07 --from-step assemble

# Lock a base ontology so the LLM won't rename its classes
mykg extract-graph my_notes/ --base-schema ontology/core.ttl
```

### Sessions

Every run automatically creates an isolated session folder:

```
mykg_sessions/
  2026-05-17T18-31-07/
    input/           ← archived copy of all input Markdown files
    intermediate/    ← all intermediate pipeline state
    output/          ← final outputs (JSONL, TTL, HTML, NetworkX)
    run.log          ← log file
    walkthrough.md   ← post-run report
```

Sessions are the primary unit of resumability. Pass `--session <name>` to resume from the last completed step. Pass `--from-step <step>` to force-restart from a specific point.

The sessions root is configurable via `pipeline.paths.sessions_dir` (default: `mykg_sessions/` in the current directory).

### Pipeline Steps

The pipeline runs 12 steps in sequence. All intermediate state is written to disk so any step can be re-entered without repeating upstream work.

| # | Step | LLM | Key outputs |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `preprocess` | — | `preprocess.done`, `preprocess_manifest.json`, files under `input/_preprocessed/` *(routes non-md inputs to MinerU or markdownify; no-op for pure Markdown corpora)* |
| 2 | `ingest` | — | `file_manifest.json` |
| 3 | `pass1` | ✓ (3 calls) | `schema.json`, `schema.ttl`, `schema_history/` |
| 4 | `schema_validate` | — | `schema_validate.done` |
| 5 | `human_review` | — | `schema_approved.flag` *(only with `--review`)* |
| 6 | `schema_flatten` | — | `flattened_schema.json` |
| 7 | `pass2` | ✓ | `raw_extractions.json`, `chunk_node_index.json` |
| 8 | `normalize_names` | ✓ | `name_normalization.json` |
| 9 | `assemble` | — | `edge_metadata.json`, `nodes.json`, `merge_log.json` |
| 10 | `orphan_score` | — | `orphan_candidates.json` |
| 11 | `orphan_connect` | ✓ | `orphan_connections.json`, `orphan_log.json` |
| 12 | `validate_graph` | — | `nodes.jsonl`, `edges.jsonl`, `knowledge_graph.ttl`, `knowledge_graph.html`, `networkx_output/`, `obsidian_vault/`, `neo4j_csv/` *(optional)* |

Pass 1 internally runs four sequential stages: parallel batch induction → algorithmic merge → harmonization LLM call → quality review LLM call.

## Outputs

### Property Graph (JSONL)

**`nodes.jsonl`** — one JSON line per entity:

```json
{
  "id": "person-alice",
  "type": "Person",
  "confidence": 0.94,
  "source_files": ["team.md"],
  "attributes": {
    "name":  {"value": "Alice",          "confidence": 1.0},
    "email": {"value": "alice@acme.com", "confidence": 0.88}
  },
  "aliases": ["Alice Smith", "A. Smith"]
}
```

**`edges.jsonl`** — one JSON line per relationship:

```json
{
  "id": "works_at-abc123",
  "type": "works_at",
  "from": "person-alice",
  "to": "org-acme-corp",
  "confidence": 0.96,
  "method": "llm_extraction",
  "attributes": {
    "role":       {"value": "Engineer", "confidence": 0.91},
    "start_date": {"value": null,       "confidence": 0.0}
  }
}
```

Missing attributes are never dropped — they are represented as `{"value": null, "confidence": 0.0}`.

The `method` field distinguishes edges extracted by Pass 2 (`llm_extraction`) from edges inferred by the orphan pass (`orphan_inferred`).

### RDF / OWL (Turtle)

**`knowledge_graph.ttl`** — pure RDFS/OWL triples, no edge metadata:

```turtle
@prefix ex: <http://mykg.local/schema/> .
@prefix :   <http://mykg.local/data/> .

ex:Person  a rdfs:Class .
ex:works_at  rdfs:domain ex:Person ;  rdfs:range ex:Organization .

:person-alice  a ex:Person ;  rdfs:label "Alice" .
:person-alice  ex:works_at  :org-acme-corp .
```

Load in Protégé, query with SPARQL (Fuseki, GraphDB), or reason with HermiT/Pellet.

### Interactive HTML

**`knowledge_graph.html`** — self-contained D3.js force-directed graph. Open in any browser, no server required. Supports:
- Filter nodes and edges by type
- Filter by confidence threshold
- Search by name
- Hover popups with full attribute values
- Resizable sidebar

### NetworkX Formats (`networkx_output/`)

| File | Format | Best for |
|---|---|---|
| `knowledge_graph.graphml` | GraphML | yEd, Gephi, Cytoscape |
| `knowledge_graph.gexf` | GEXF | Gephi native (rich metadata) |
| `knowledge_graph.json` | JSON node-link | D3.js, Sigma.js, web apps |
| `knowledge_graph.gml` | GML | Human-readable inspection |
| `knowledge_graph.net` | Pajek | Network analysis |
| `edges_nx.txt` | Edge list | Text pipelines |
| `adjacency.txt` | Adjacency list | Topology consumers |

Node/edge attributes are exported as `attr_<name>_value` / `attr_<name>_confidence` scalar pairs for GML compatibility.

### Obsidian Vault (`obsidian_vault/`)

One `.md` note per extracted entity, grouped into subdirectories by concept type. Each note has YAML frontmatter (id, type, confidence, sources), an attributes section, outgoing and incoming wikilink relationship sections, and a source files list. An `index.md` at the vault root summarizes node counts per type with links to every entity.

Open `output/obsidian_vault/` as a vault in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) to get Graph View, backlink navigation, and full-text search across the extracted entities.

### Neo4j LOAD CSV Bundle (`neo4j_csv/`)

Optional, off by default. Enable with `--neo4j-csv` on the command line, or set `pipeline.export.neo4j_csv_enabled: true` in `mykg_config.yaml`.

When enabled, `step_validate_graph` writes a self-contained Neo4j import bundle next to the other outputs:

```
output/neo4j_csv/
  nodes_<Label>.csv             ← one per concept type (Person, Organization, …)
  relationships_<TYPE>.csv      ← one per property (WORKS_AT, KNOWS, …)
  import_browser.cypher         ← paste-and-run for Neo4j Browser
  import_shell.cypher           ← for `cypher-shell -f`
  README.md                     ← bundle-local quick-reference
```

Plain CSV headers (`id,name,name_confidence,_node_confidence,_parents,_source_files,...`) — no `:ID` / `:LABEL` decorations, so the same files work for both Neo4j and any other CSV-aware tool.

**Two ways to import the bundle:**

```bash
# Flow A — Neo4j Browser
# 1. Copy *.csv into your DBMS's import/ directory
# 2. Paste the contents of import_browser.cypher and press play

# Flow B — cypher-shell (set dbms.security.allow_csv_import_from_file_urls=true first)
cypher-shell -u neo4j -p <pw> -f output/neo4j_csv/import_shell.cypher
```

Both scripts use idempotent `MERGE` against a `_MykgNode` uniqueness constraint, so re-running updates the graph in place. Requires Neo4j 5+. No Python driver, no plugin, no APOC — the scripts use only core Cypher.

See [Neo4j LOAD CSV Export](#neo4j-load-csv-export) below for configuration details and the standalone CLI fallback.

### Re-running from a Specific Step

Use `--from-step` to delete a step's outputs and all downstream outputs, then re-run from that point.

```bash
SESSION=2026-05-17T18-31-07

# Re-run from Pass 2 (reuse the existing schema)
mykg extract-graph my_notes/ --session $SESSION --from-step pass2

# Re-run only assembly + export (reuse raw extractions)
mykg extract-graph my_notes/ --session $SESSION --from-step assemble

# Re-run both orphan stages
mykg extract-graph my_notes/ --session $SESSION --from-step orphan_score

# Orphan LLM pass only — full clean sweep
mykg extract-graph my_notes/ --session $SESSION --from-step orphan_connect_fullsweep

# Orphan LLM pass only — additive (preserves prior confirmed edges)
mykg extract-graph my_notes/ --session $SESSION --from-step orphan_connect_incremental
```

**Four re-entry patterns:**

| Pattern | When to use | Command |
|---|---|---|
| **A — Schema changed** | Wrong concept types, missing properties | Edit `schema.json` → `approve-schema` → `--from-step pass1` |
| **B — Extraction errors** | LLM missed entities or invented edge types | Edit shard in `raw_extractions_shards/` → `--from-step pass2` |
| **C — Assembly errors** | Bad dedup decisions in `merge_log.json` | Edit `raw_extractions.json` → `--from-step assemble` |
| **D — Orphan pass** | Wrong candidates or confirmations | `--from-step orphan_score` or `orphan_connect_fullsweep` |

### Orphan-Connection Pass

After assembly, nodes with zero edges are "orphans" — present in the graph but unreachable by traversal. The orphan pass reconnects them in two stages:

**Stage 1 — `orphan_score` (no LLM):** Uses `chunk_node_index.json` to find nodes that co-occur in the same source chunk as each orphan. Candidates are scored by co-occurrence frequency and filtered by schema type compatibility. Written to `orphan_candidates.json`.

**Stage 2 — `orphan_connect` (LLM):** One LLM call per source chunk. The prompt includes the full chunk text, all orphan IDs from that chunk, co-occurring connected nodes, and all schema properties. Confirmed edges carry `"method": "orphan_inferred"` and are merged directly into `edge_metadata.json`.

Unconnectable orphans (no resolvable source chunk) are logged as `orphan_unconnectable` advisory events in `orphan_log.json`.

Configure via `pipeline.orphan_pass.*` in `mykg_config.yaml`. Disable entirely with `pipeline.orphan_pass.enabled: false`.

## Advanced Options

### Human Review Gate (`--review`)

Pause after Pass 1 to inspect and edit the induced schema before Pass 2 runs:

```bash
mykg extract-graph my_notes/ --review
# → pipeline halts; edit mykg_sessions/<name>/intermediate/schema.json
mykg approve-schema --session <name>
mykg extract-graph my_notes/ --session <name> --review   # resumes from Pass 2
```

### Locked Base Schema (`--base-schema`)

Lock certain classes and properties so the LLM cannot rename, remove, or restructure them:

```bash
mykg extract-graph my_notes/ --base-schema ontology/base.ttl
```

Locked entries can still receive additional attributes proposed by the LLM. Near-duplicate LLM proposals are collapsed into the locked entry with a warning.

### SKOS Thesaurus (`--thesaurus`)

Resolve near-duplicate concept names during schema merge using a SKOS vocabulary:

```bash
mykg extract-graph my_notes/ --thesaurus ontology/terms.skos.ttl
```

- `skos:exactMatch` → silent collapse
- `skos:closeMatch` → collapse with warning in `merge_log.json`
- `skos:broader` / `skos:narrower` → advisory hints only

### Append Mode

Re-run the pipeline on new or modified files without re-running Pass 1:

```bash
mykg extract-graph my_notes/ --session <name> --append
```

> **Note:** Append mode currently only supports adding or updating `.md` files. Mixed-format inputs (PDF, DOCX, HTML, etc. — i.e. anything requiring the `preprocess` step) are not yet supported on the `--append` code path. As a workaround, convert non-Markdown files to Markdown manually with `mykg parse-docs` first, then point `--append` at the converted output:
>
> ```bash
> mykg parse-docs --input raw_docs/ --output my_notes/
> mykg extract-graph my_notes/ --session <name> --append
> ```
>
> `parse-docs` recurses subdirectories and preserves their structure at the output; per-file failures (e.g. an unsupported format in the input tree) are logged and the run continues, exiting non-zero at the end if any file failed.

### Merging Sessions

Combine two independently-produced sessions into a unified knowledge graph:

```bash
mykg merge-graphs <session-A> <session-B> [OPTIONS]

# Example
mykg merge-graphs 2026-05-01T10-00-00 2026-05-15T14-30-00

# Resume a merge (last incomplete step auto-detected)
mykg merge-graphs A B --output-session <merged-name>
```

**Options:**

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| `--output-session TEXT` | Name for the merged session (default: auto-timestamped) |
| `--no-review` | Skip the human review gate after schema merge |
| `--thesaurus PATH` | SKOS thesaurus for schema synonym matching |
| `--base-schema PATH` | Locked TBox TTL base schema |
| `--from-step NAME` | Force re-run from a specific merge step |

**What happens:**

1. Both schemas are merged via the same three-stage chain as Pass 1 (algorithmic union → LLM harmonization → LLM quality review)
2. All file-keyed structures are namespaced (`session_a/<filename>`, `session_b/<filename>`) before merging
3. Nodes are deduplicated across sessions: same type + canonical name → single node, regardless of source session
4. Re-extraction strategy (`none` / `surgical` / `full`) handles properties absent from one session's schema
5. `source_map.json` records full file provenance; `merge_manifest.json` records schema deltas and strategy used
6. `walkthrough.md` includes a Merge Provenance section with before/after counts and node/edge breakdowns

Configure the re-extraction strategy:

```yaml
merge_graphs:
  reextraction_strategy: surgical   # none | surgical | full
```

### Obsidian Vault Export

Every run writes a linked Markdown vault to `output/obsidian_vault/` by default. Open that folder in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) to explore the extracted knowledge graph with Graph View and backlinks.

**Vault structure:**

```
output/obsidian_vault/
  index.md                  ← overview: node count per type, links to every entity
  Person/
    person-alice-smith.md   ← one note per entity
    person-bob-jones.md
  Organization/
    organization-acme-corp.md
  ...
```

**Each entity note contains:**

```markdown
---
id: person-alice-smith
type: Person
confidence: 0.94
sources:
  - team.md
---

# Alice Smith

## Attributes
- **role**: Engineer (0.91)
- **email**: alice@acme.com (1.0)

## Relationships

### Outgoing
- [[Acme Corp]] — works_at (0.96)

### Incoming
- [[Bob Jones]] — manages (0.88)

## Source Files
- team.md
```

Wikilinks (`[[...]]`) are Obsidian-native — clicking them in the app navigates to the linked entity note, and the Graph View shows the full relationship network automatically.

**Config:**

```yaml
pipeline:
  export:
    obsidian_enabled: true          # default — set false to skip vault export
    obsidian_vault_dir: obsidian_vault   # subfolder name inside output/
```

Or use `--obsidian-vault` on the command line for a one-off run without editing config.

### Neo4j LOAD CSV Export

Optional bundle for one-step import into Neo4j 5+. Off by default. When enabled, every run writes the bundle to `output/neo4j_csv/` alongside the other outputs.

**Bundle contents** (see [`neo4j_csv/`](#neo4j-load-csv-bundle-neo4j_csv) above for the full layout):
- One `nodes_<Label>.csv` per concept type with plain headers (`id,name,name_confidence,...`)
- One `relationships_<TYPE>.csv` per property (rel-type names sanitized to upper snake_case)
- `import_browser.cypher` — paste-and-run for Neo4j Browser (relative `file:/<name>.csv` URIs)
- `import_shell.cypher` — for `cypher-shell -f` (absolute `file:///` URIs)
- `README.md` — bundle-local quick-reference with paste instructions

**The scripts use:**
1. A uniqueness constraint on `(_MykgNode {id})` — created on first run, `IF NOT EXISTS` thereafter
2. `MERGE` for every node and edge — idempotent, safe to re-run
3. `IN TRANSACTIONS OF 1000 ROWS` — handles large bundles without OOM
4. Per-label domain labels (`:Person`, `:Organization`) plus the shared `:_MykgNode` label that carries the constraint

**Config:**

```yaml
pipeline:
  export:
    neo4j_csv_enabled: false        # default — set true to enable
    neo4j_csv_dir: neo4j_csv        # subfolder name inside output/
```

Or use `--neo4j-csv` on the command line for a one-off run without editing config.

### Walkthrough Report

A human-readable summary is written to `mykg_sessions/<name>/walkthrough.md` after every run:

```bash
# Regenerate the walkthrough for an existing session
mykg walkthrough --session 2026-05-17T18-31-07
```

Disable with `pipeline.report.enabled: false`.

## Using mykg with Claude Code

myKG ships with two complementary integrations for running extractions from inside [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code):

- **`claude-cli` profile** — the pipeline shells out to the `claude -p` binary for each LLM step. Serial only.
- **Agent mode (`agent-claude-code` profile + bundled skill)** — the pipeline writes LLM tasks to a session-local inbox folder and a Claude Code skill dispatches subagents to answer them. Parallel by default.

Pick the first for a drop-in `claude`-as-LLM experience; pick the second when you want parallel subagent dispatch and inspectable JSON I/O.

### claude-cli profile

myKG ships with a `claude-cli` profile that runs extractions through the locally-installed `claude` CLI.

#### Setup

Install the `claude` CLI, then install mykg and run the setup wizard — select **[5] Claude CLI** when prompted.

```bash
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
pip install mykg && mykg init
mykg extract-graph my_notes/
```

#### How it works

The `claude-cli` provider calls `claude -p` as a subprocess for every LLM step (Pass 1 schema induction, Pass 2 extraction, orphan connection, name normalization). All pipeline features — session isolation, resumability, orphan recovery, cross-session merge — work identically to API-based providers.

**Key constraints of the `claude-cli` profile:**
- `max_workers` must be `1` — the `claude` CLI is serial by design; parallel workers will queue
- The `effort` and `model` fields in `mykg_config.yaml` map directly to `--effort` and `--model` flags passed to `claude -p`

#### Using myKG from inside Claude Code Session

You can run myKG extractions as a tool call from within a Claude Code session. This is useful for building knowledge graphs from notes or documentation while you work:

```bash
# From any Claude Code session terminal:
mykg extract-graph ./docs/ --session my-docs-kg

# Then reference the output in your session:
# mykg_sessions/my-docs-kg/output/nodes.jsonl
# mykg_sessions/my-docs-kg/output/knowledge_graph.ttl
```

Claude Code can then read `nodes.jsonl` or `edges.jsonl` as well as the Obsidian vault directly to answer questions about the extracted graph, or load `knowledge_graph.ttl` into a SPARQL tool for structured queries.

### Agent mode (Claude Code skill)

Agent mode is a different way to run myKG inside Claude Code: instead of `claude -p` subprocesses, the pipeline writes LLM tasks to a session-local inbox folder and a Claude Code **skill** dispatches subagents to answer them. Pick agent mode over `claude-cli` when you want parallel subagent dispatch from inside an active Claude Code session.

#### Why pick agent mode

- **No API key needed.** Uses your existing Claude Pro/Max plan via the skill subagents — same as `claude-cli`, but without invoking the `claude -p` binary.
- **Inspectable LLM I/O.** Every prompt lands as `intermediate/agent_inbox/<id>.task.json` and every answer as `intermediate/agent_outbox/<id>.answer.json`. Replay or edit any step by hand.
- **Parallel by default.** The skill dispatches up to `pass2.max_workers` subagents per wave in a single message — not serial like `claude-cli`. Pass-2 chunks complete in parallel waves.

#### Install and configure

```bash
pip install mykg          # or: uv tool install mykg
mykg init --profile agent-claude-code
# ...then restart Claude Code so the skill loader picks up the new entry.
```

`mykg init --profile agent-claude-code` writes `mykg_config.yaml`, copies the bundled skill into `~/.claude/skills/mykg` (honoring `$CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` if set), *and* adds a managed `<!-- BEGIN mykg-section --> ... <!-- END mykg-section -->` block to the project's `CLAUDE.md`. A `.mykg_skill_version` stamp file is written next to the skill so future runs can detect drift; the CLAUDE.md block tells Claude Code where the wiki lives, how to find the most-recent session, and how to extend the graph with new documents (no separate setup required).

**Upgrade after `pip install -U mykg`:**

```bash
mykg init --reinstall-skill --reinstall-claude-md
```

This atomically refreshes the bundled skill (copy to `.tmp` → `os.replace`) without touching your `mykg_config.yaml`, and replaces the content between the CLAUDE.md markers with the version shipped in the current package — any user content outside the markers is preserved. Either flag can be used alone (`--reinstall-skill` only / `--reinstall-claude-md` only). The copy-based skill install is deliberately not a symlink — symlinks fail on Windows without Developer Mode, dangle if mykg is uninstalled, and don't sync through OneDrive. The cost (live edits don't auto-propagate) only matters for mykg developers, who pass `--reinstall-skill` between edits.

The `agent:` block in the generated `mykg_config.yaml` configures the inbox/outbox paths and poll interval:

```yaml
profile: agent-claude-code

profiles:
  agent-claude-code:
    provider: agent
    agent:
      inbox_dir: agent_inbox        # relative to <session>/intermediate/
      outbox_dir: agent_outbox
      poll_interval_seconds: 2
    pipeline:
      pass2:
        max_workers: 8              # how many subagents the skill dispatches per wave
```

#### Invoke from inside Claude Code

The skill exposes one slash command — `/mykg` — that accepts free-form intent. You describe what you want; the skill figures out which `mykg` CLI command to run, reads the live `--help` to validate flags, confirms expensive actions, and (for `extract-graph`) drains the LLM inbox in parallel waves.

Examples:

| You type | The skill runs |
| --- | --- |
| `/mykg extract ./docs` | `mykg extract-graph ./docs` |
| `/mykg ./docs` | `mykg extract-graph ./docs` (legacy positional alias) |
| `/mykg extract ./docs with human review` | `mykg extract-graph ./docs --review` |
| `/mykg append the new notes in ./docs` | `mykg extract-graph ./docs --append --session <latest>` |
| `/mykg resume the last session` | `mykg extract-graph --session <latest>` |
| `/mykg approve the schema` | `mykg approve-schema --session <latest>` |
| `/mykg make a walkthrough` | `mykg walkthrough --session <latest>` |
| `/mykg convert pdfs in ./inbox to ./md` | `mykg parse-docs --input ./inbox --output ./md` |

Any flag mykg accepts on the CLI works here too — the skill reads `--help` rather than maintaining its own list, so `--from-step orphan_connect`, `--workers 8`, `--obsidian-vault`, etc. all flow through.

`mykg init` and `mykg merge-graphs` are intentionally not wrapped: init is interactive (run from a shell once per machine), and merge-graphs has additional design questions and will be added in a follow-up.

Full design and contract: [docs/agent-mode.md](docs/agent-mode.md). Skill source: [src/mykg/data/skills/mykg/SKILL.md](src/mykg/data/skills/mykg/SKILL.md).

## Obsidian vault tips

Each entity note carries a `tags` property set from its type (e.g. `#Person`,
`#Document`), and source documents are notes under `sources/` tagged `#Source`.
Use Obsidian **Graph view → Groups** to recolor these: add a group with query
`tag:#Document` to highlight one entity type, or `path:sources/` to highlight
source documents. Groups only recolor nodes — they do not change graph topology.
The `neighbors` frontmatter list (each `{link, confidence}`) is queryable with
Dataview, e.g. to surface an entity's strongest first-hop connections.
